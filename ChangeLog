  * library/api.c, library/utils.c: replace the separate BOOL parameters by a
    combined flags variable.

2009-05-18  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * prefs/popport.c: added a comment about the unsafe Forbid() situation while
    adding items to an MUI list. Just to make sure this is not forgotten.
  * library/handler.c, library/utils.c: replaced the Forbid()/Permit() pair to
    protect access
    to the rexx_use var by usage of the library base semaphore.
  * misc: replaced almost all strcpy() calls by strlcpy(). Also removed the
    custom msnprintf() function as they are longer used.
  * library/api.c: lots of code clean up to make things more readable.
  * misc: replaced several ULONG results by proper BOOL types.
  * misc: added the usual ENTER()/LEAVE()/RETURN() macro calls to all functions.

  * library: completely reworked the build system of openurl.library. Now the SDI
    headers are used and a generic libinit.c. All this has been transferred
    from the codesets.library project and should make future improvements more
    easy. Please note, however, that the library needs a lot of testing now
    until we consider a new official release. So please go and see if it works
    with all kind of platforms and applications you have.

  * misc: lots of type changes to make the source compilable for OS4.
