  * misc: replaced several ULONG results by proper BOOL types.
  * misc: added the usual ENTER()/LEAVE()/RETURN() macro calls to all functions.

  * library: completely reworked the build system of openurl.library. Now the SDI
    headers are used and a generic libinit.c. All this has been transferred
    from the codesets.library project and should make future improvements more
    easy. Please note, however, that the library needs a lot of testing now
    until we consider a new official release. So please go and see if it works
    with all kind of platforms and applications you have.

  * misc: lots of type changes to make the source compilable for OS4.
