  * prefs, misc: now the preference application also properly compiles and
    links for AROS. If it works have to be seen. But it looks quite promising.
  * prefs: fixed MOS compilation by updating the ppcinline header files
  * prefs: converted the build system of the MUI preferences application to
    use the generic Makefile we use with every application. Also converted
    everything to use the SDI headers. OS4 compilation seems to work fine and
    the app seems also to work properly. However, further testing and
    especially work into getting it compiled/linked for OS3 and MOS have to
    be done.

  * prefs/OpenURL.c: added debugging initialization.
  * prefs: fixed all remaining issues with the OS3 build. Now the preferences
    program compiles perfectly for OS3 and OS4.
  * prefs: replaced all stccpy() calls by strlcpy().
  * prefs/*.c fixed tons of warnings. At least the OS4 build is done without a
    single warning.
  * library/*.c: replaced all handcrafted flag checks by macro calls.
  * library/api.c, library/utils.c: replace the separate BOOL parameters by a
    combined flags variable.

  * prefs/popport.c: added a comment about the unsafe Forbid() situation while
    adding items to an MUI list. Just to make sure this is not forgotten.
  * library/handler.c, library/utils.c: replaced the Forbid()/Permit() pair to
    protect access
    to the rexx_use var by usage of the library base semaphore.
  * misc: replaced almost all strcpy() calls by strlcpy(). Also removed the
    custom msnprintf() function as they are longer used.
  * library/api.c: lots of code clean up to make things more readable.
  * misc: replaced several ULONG results by proper BOOL types.
  * misc: added the usual ENTER()/LEAVE()/RETURN() macro calls to all functions.

2009-05-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * library: completely reworked the build system of openurl.library. Now the SDI
    headers are used and a generic libinit.c. All this has been transferred
    from the codesets.library project and should make future improvements more
    easy. Please note, however, that the library needs a lot of testing now
    until we consider a new official release. So please go and see if it works
    with all kind of platforms and applications you have.

  * misc: lots of type changes to make the source compilable for OS4.
